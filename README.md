# Feed store

## Project Pitch

Home page of cat food products

## Product Features

The things our app can do to help you:

- Displays feed options;
- Provides summary information about the composition and volume of feed;
- Simulates the selected product with color and text;
- (WIP: more features coming soon)

## How to start the App

Use 'Live Server' (IDE Visual Studio Code) or open index.html -  to run the server

The server will start and the app will be opened in a new tab in your browser.
You can stop the server by simply closing the terminal in which you started it.
